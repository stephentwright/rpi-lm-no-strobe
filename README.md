# OORPI LM: Outside only raspberry pi launch monitor

Welcome to the project! This project aims to create an easy and accessible golf ball launch monitor that will work outside in the wonderfully broad light spectrum outside. Other Rpi projects seek to give you the best golfsim experience indoors, we aim to get you hitting balls outside and watching those numbers improve.
